# Dondo.ai

Inspired by the tonality of the Dondo drum, **Dondo.ai** is a project designed to help Africans access the internet in their native language. By utilizing audio-based interactions through WhatsApp, Dondo.ai enables users to participate in surveys and polls simply by sending a message. The system responds with an audio message, making it accessible even in regions where English is not the primary language of communication.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- **Developers**: Build voice-based surveys and interactions in non-English languages.
- **Businesses**: Conduct surveys and gather data from a wider audience in their native tongue, particularly in regions where English isn't the language of commerce.
